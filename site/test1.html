                My experience with love.
            </h2>
            <p>
                When a person is in love, very wierd things happpen.
                Suddenly the whole world around you changes, you start feeling the inevitable
                presence everywhere. No corner in this world feels empty, everytime it feels like you are on
                the last of the fuel amd want to rush before its too late.
                A freindly suggestion from my side, never ever rush for things enjoy the time until it's over.
                It is very much similar to life, the slower it goes the loneger it remains in memory.
